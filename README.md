# quizzical
Quizzical is the final solo project of the Learn React for Free course in Scrimba. It is a simple game that allows you to answer the 5 questions fetched from an API.

This is my first React project and also the first time using an API. It feels good to have a dynamic part of my App. I'll still be cleaning up my code since it's all over the place in terms of my naming schemes but all-in-all the app works how it should. 

I have added some additional features to the supposed app. You can now reset the game with the Reset Game buttons which essentially just gets new questions. Another feature is that there will be an error message that pop-ups when you press the Check Answers button if you have incomplete answers.

I had so much fun with this project. It's a pretty straightforward application of my React knowledge. I've had some troubles regarding the Component Lifecycle, how they re-render and what not but I've gotten the hang of it. 

I'm so stoked that I have only just scratched the surface of what React is truly capable of! See you on my next project! :)
